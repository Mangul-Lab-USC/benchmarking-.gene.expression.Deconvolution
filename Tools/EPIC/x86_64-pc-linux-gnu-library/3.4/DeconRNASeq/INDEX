DeconRNASeq             Function for Deconvolution of Complex Samples
                        from RNA-Seq.
DeconRNASeq_package     package DeconRNASeq contains function
                        "DeconRNASeq", implementing the decomposition
                        of RNA-Seq expression profilings of
                        heterogeneous tissues into cell/tissue type
                        specific expression and cell type concentration
                        based on cell-type-specific reference
                        measurements.
